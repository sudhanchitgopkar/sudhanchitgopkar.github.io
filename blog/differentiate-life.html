<h1> Can I Differentiate Your Life? </h1>
I've been thinking a lot about my friends recently – especially as my relationship with them has become long-distance. In many cases, I feel that I no longer know them quite as well anymore. This isn't a profound realization – certainly, as we see people less frequently, we begin to miss little (and sometimes bigger) parts of their life. But it seems like what we miss is more than the events themselves; it's the underlying impacts that these events have on people's thought-processes and decision-making paradigms of others. It strikes me that there is an awfully elegant connection to calculus here.

If we think of people's lives as functions (leave it to mathematicians to reduce, even life, to a function), then these functions must be continuous and (I argue) differentiable. Say what you will of points and cusps in the function of life, but locally these, too, are smooth. Seeing someone's function of life, then, gives us the ability to differentiate it! We can understand all sorts of incredible properties about it – whether it's increasing (getting better?) or decreasing (getting worse?), and where the local maxima (perhaps a birthday or a new job) and minima (a breakup or rough patch with a partner) are. But seeing the full function of a person's life requires presence, for it is only through the continuity of the function that we get the ability to differentiate it. As many of my friendships have become longer-distance, my view of these friend's functions have turned from smooth to piecewise, and I have begun to lose many of the insights I was once able to gain through differentiability. Once again, calculus and mathematics more broadly reveals itself to be a head-fake. One of these days, I'll actually differentiate a function and have to refresh myself on trig derivatives and the chain rule. Until then, though, understanding calculus will have been far more useful in simply being a lens through which to understand the increasingly complicated world.
