<h1> Can I Differentiate Your Life? </h1>
I've been thinking a lot about my friends recently – I've been seeing many of them for the first time in many months, even years (I realize this is probably not much time in the grand scheme of things but a year makes a world of difference at 22). In many cases, I feel that I can no longer fully understand their choices, opinions, or beliefs in the same way that I did when I was around them every day just a few years prior. This isn't a profound realization – certainly, as we see people less frequently we begin to miss little (and sometimes bigger) things which shape who they are and guide the aforementioned choices, opinions, and beliefs. It strikes me that there is an awfully elegant connection to calculus here.

If we think of people's lives as functions (leave it to mathematicians to reduce, even life, to a function), then these functions must be continuous and (I argue) differentiable. Say what you will of points and cusps in the function of life, but locally these, too, are smooth. Seeing someone's function of life, then, gives us the ability to differentiate it! We can understand all sorts of incredible properties about it – whether it's increasing (getting better?) or decreasing (getting worse?), and where the local maxima (perhaps a birthday or a new job) and minima (a breakup or rough patch with a partner) are. But seeing the full function of a person's life requires presence, for it is only through the continuity of the function that we get the ability to differentiate it. As I have become more absent from the lives of my friends (through no fault of mine or theirs), my view of their function has turned from smooth to piecewise, and I have begun to lose many of the insights I was once able to gain through differentiability. Once again, calculus and mathematics more broadly reveals itself to be a head-fake. One of these days, I'll actually differentiate a function and have to refresh myself on trig derivatives and the chain rule. Until then, though, understanding calculus will have been far more useful in simply being a lens through which to understand the increasingly complicated world around me.
