        <p>Hey, I'm Sudhan.</p>
        <p>
            I'm interested in applying computation to problems in economics, financial markets, game theory, and security. 
            I graduated from <a href="https://harvard.edu">Harvard</a> in 2024 with a Master's in Computational Science + Engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
            I spent my time at Harvard equally across the mathematics, computer science, and economics departments. There, 
            I worked with Prof. David Parkes on new algorithmic market-making algorithms for prediction markets, Dr. Moshe 
            Hoffman on game-theoretic models for conflict escalation, and with the <a href="https://www.hmc.harvard.edu/about/">Harvard Management Company</a> on ML models 
            to streamline investment decision-making on Harvard's $60B+ endowment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before that, I spent a few summers at <a href="https://amazon.com">Amazon</a> as a SWE intern automating load-shedding protocols to reduce downtime of <span class=code-inline>amazon.com</span>
            and at <a href="https://www.southerncompany.com/innovation/vogtle-3-and-4.html">Southern Company</a> doing data science and threat intelligence to trace an international criminal. 
        </p>
        <p>
            When I'm not working, you can usually find me tinkering with generative art 
            (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=la8MevQxLZw">my TEDx talk</a>) and mathematical visualizations 
            (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvd1Jnr-T4c&list=PLtHrXQsUhv82Iqqdx9y5r3qA9WsEaU9jv">my Harvard course</a>), listening to music, or reading 
            (<a href="https://sudhan.dev/reading-list">my reading list</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm currently engineering intelligence infrastructure at <a href="https://palantir.com">Palantir</a> and ML Research at Harvard. If any of my work interests you, feel free to drop me a line at 
            <span class="code-block">sudhan [at] alumni.harvard.edu</span>.
        </p>
        <p>Cheers,<br>Sudhan</p>
